    "nutrition_vegan": "How about a delightful quinoa salad with mixed veggies and a tangy citrus dressing? Or try a creamy avocado toast sprinkled with hemp seeds. Fuel up with plant-based power!",
    "nutrition_vegetarian": "Enjoy a hearty chickpea and spinach curry with basmati rice or a refreshing Greek salad with feta cheese and olives. Think balance, nourishment, and flavor.",
    "sports": "Your body is ready to embrace movement! A refreshing yoga session or a brisk walk in nature would be perfect. Focus on activities that bring you joy and balance.",
