  "tldr": "TL;DR",
  "output": {
    "astro": "Youâ€™re a Libra, darling, born on October 6, 1990, with Venus as your ruling planet. Venus is all about love, beauty, and harmony. Today, Venus is in Sagittarius, making you feel a bit adventurous and perhaps even a bit restless!",
    "people": "Patience is your keyword today. As your cycle is wrapping up its menstrual phase, you might be more introspective. Take deep breaths and channel that Libra diplomacy. Kill â€™em with kindness and your radiant smile.",
    "me": "People see you as grounded and calm. Your serene aura today is super appealing. Even if you don't feel your best, you're still exuding a peaceful energy people are gravitating towards.",
    "finance": "Play it safe, lovely. December can be a tempting month to splurge, especially with Venus in Sagittarius. Stick to your budget but allow a tiny treatâ€”think of it as investing in yourself.",
    "behavior": "You might feel a sudden urge to break free and roam or drop what youâ€™re doing and start a completely new task. Embrace your whimsical side but keep it in check!",
    "evening_extro": "Put on something fabulous and hit the town! Venus in Sagittarius loves socializing. Go to a local concert, dine out with friends, or attend a fun class.",
    "evening_intro": "Curl up with a good book or binge-watch a new series. Light a nice scented candle and have a self-care night. Lavender and chamomile are great choices for relaxation.",
    "nutrition_all": "Indulge in some hearty comfort food. Maybe a warm bowl of soup or pasta with a little extra cheese. Ease back into normal eating with foods that make you feel cozy and satisfied.",
    "nutrition_vegan": "Think along the lines of a nourishing vegan stew or a vibrant salad with all the trimmings. A vegan pizza with loads of veggies could also hit the spot!",
    "nutrition_vegetarian": "How about a delightful veggie lasagna or a tofu stir-fry packed with fresh greens? Donâ€™t forget a yummy smoothie packed with antioxidants for that extra boost!",
    "sports": "Light activities are the way to go. Maybe some gentle yoga or a relaxing walk in the park. Listen to your body and donâ€™t push too hard today.",
    "quote": "Even in the darkest phases, the moon finds a way to glow.",
    "motto": "Grace under pressure.",
    "footer": "Alright, cosmic queen, you've got the planets on your side. Go be fabulous! Remember, today is a new chance to let your inner goddess shine. ðŸŒºâœ¨"
